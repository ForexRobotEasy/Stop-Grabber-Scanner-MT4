This function enables the tool to work with multiple timeframes. It scans for the pattern and generates signals on different timeframes, including MN1, W1, D1, H4, H1, M30, M15, M5, and M1. It implements code logic to scan for the pattern and generate signals on these timeframes.

### start()

This is the main function of the code. It checks if Market Watch scanning is enabled. If it is, it calls the `ScanStopGrabberPattern()` and `GenerateSignals()` functions. It then checks if the signals repaint using the `CheckRepainting()` function. If the signals do not repaint, it calls the `ScanAllMarkets()` and `ScanMultipleTimeframes()` functions. If the signals repaint, it prints a message asking the user to adjust parameters. If Market Watch scanning is disabled, it prints a message asking the user to enable it in the parameters.
